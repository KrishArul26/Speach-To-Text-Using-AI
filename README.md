<p style= 'text-align: justify;'> Speech - Recognition is an important feature for severalapplications which isÂ  used such as home automation, artificial intelligence, etc. Thisproject aims to give an overview of how to make use of the Speech - Recognitionlibrary of Python for Daily usages. This is useful as it can be used on micro-controllers such as the Raspberry-PI module.Â The technology allows us to talk to a computer or device that interpretswhat weâ€™re saying in order to respond to our question or command.
